## My Journey: Building a Virtual Security Lab with Proxmox

I'd love to share one of my favorite projects: setting up a home cybersecurity lab using Proxmox on a Beelink SER5 Mini PC. This project combines my passion for hands-on learning with practical cybersecurity skillsâ€”and I've learned a ton along the way!

### Why This Matters
Before diving into the technical details, let me explain why this project excites me. This lab serves as my personal testing ground where I can safely:
- Experiment with security tools and configurations
- Practice incident response scenarios
- Learn new cybersecurity techniques
- Test security solutions before implementing them

### The Setup Journey: Making It Happen

#### Planning Phase
Just like in a professional environment, I started with careful planning:
- Researched the best hardware for my needs (the Beelink SER5 proved perfect!)
- Created a detailed checklist to ensure nothing was missed
- Kept security in mind from the very beginning
- Documented everything (a habit I learned in my nursing days)

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Getting Started**
   - Downloaded Proxmox VE (always from the official source!)
   - Verified everything was secure and legitimate
   - Created my installation media using Balena Etcher

2. **BIOS Setup**
   - Accessed the BIOS (quick tip: DEL key during startup)
   - Enabled important security features
   - Set everything up for a smooth installation

3. **Installation and Security**
   - Installed Proxmox VE with security in mind
   - Set up strong passwords and authentication
   - Made sure everything was properly configured

4. **Network Setup**
   - Configured the network securely
   - Set up protective firewall rules
   - Ensured safe remote access
   - Added monitoring to keep an eye on things

5. **Making It Secure**
   - Updated everything to the latest versions
   - Added extra security measures
   - Set up regular backups (because better safe than sorry!)

### What I've Learned

This project has taught me so much about:
- Managing virtual environments securely
- Implementing security best practices
- Solving technical challenges
- Documentation and process improvement

### Where I'm Heading

I'm constantly improving this lab by:
- Adding new security tools to test
- Improving backup systems
- Refining system efficiency and performance
- Strengthening security measures
- Hosting my own services
- Automation with **Ansible**

### The Real-World Connection

Everything I've learned from this project directly applies to real-world cybersecurity work. I'm excited about the possibility of bringing these skills and my enthusiasm for continuous learning to a professional role, where I can contribute to building and maintaining secure systems while growing alongside experienced team members.

What started as a personal project has become an incredible learning platform, and I'm always happy to share my experiences or learn from others in the field. I'd love to discuss how these hands-on skills could benefit your team's cybersecurity initiatives!

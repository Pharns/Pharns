# Homelab Setup

This documentation showcases my Proxmox-based homelab environment—a crucial element of my personal portfolio demonstrating my capabilities in cybersecurity research and testing.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Virtualization with Proxmox VE:** Efficiently utilizes Proxmox VE to build and manage a diverse array of virtual machines. This platform enables the agile deployment necessary for running complex simulations and experiments.
- **Diverse Security Tool Deployment:** Features dedicated virtual machines configured with industry-standard tools like Security Onion and Kali Linux, designed to mimic real-world cybersecurity infrastructures and scenarios.
- **Robust Network Segmentation:** Uses VLANs for meticulous traffic isolation, allowing for safe and isolated testing environments. This practice ensures controlled conditions for penetration testing and network security trials.
- **Secure Intranet Configuration with Tailscale:** Implements Tailscale to establish an encrypted and secure communication channel within the lab, further reinforcing the isolated and protected status of the network against external threats.
- **Practical Network Topology Visualization:** The network diagram provides a comprehensive view of the homelab’s architecture, designed to highlight segmentation strategies and secure interconnections best suited for defense-in-depth practices.

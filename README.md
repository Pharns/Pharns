# Pharns Genece

**GRC Engineer · Cloud Security · Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Cybersecurity**

I build audit-ready control frameworks, evidence pipelines, and compliance automation — then implement the technical controls, not just document them. Rare hybrid: GRC discipline meets RF/aviation security and cyber-physical systems expertise. AI-augmented delivery at 10× capacity.

## What I Build

**TraceLock™** *(Patent Pending)* — Multi-domain RF threat detection platform monitoring Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, SDR, GPS, and ADS-B simultaneously. 8+ Python modules, 52 shell scripts, security-hardened architecture.

**GIAP™** — AI-powered governance intake platform with consent management, retention policies, and NIST-aligned control mapping.

**AWS Cloud Control Pack** — S3 default-deny storage, GuardDuty findings export, scoped IAM roles with CIS/NIST mapping.

**PCI-DSS Windows 11 Hardening** — Complete endpoint hardening with GPO, firewall rules, BitLocker, and audit-ready evidence pack delivered in <48 hours.

## AAM Cybersecurity Specialization

**I don't just secure drones — I've designed, built, and fielded UAV systems.**

Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) security requires practitioners who understand the engineering, not just the vulnerabilities. I bring hands-on experience across the full lifecycle:

| Capability | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **UAV Engineering** | Designed, built, and fielded operational UAV systems |
| **Granted Patents** | USPTO patents in UAV payload and delivery architectures |
| **RF Threat Detection** | TraceLock™ with ADS-B integration for drone surveillance detection |
| **Aviation Credentials** | FAA Part 107 certified drone pilot |
| **SDR/Wireless Security** | HackRF, RTL-SDR, Kismet — spectrum analysis and signal intelligence |
| **Consulting Practice** | AAM Cyber, LLC — cyber-physical security services |
| **Military Aviation** | USAF aeromedical operations background |

## Why Hire Me

Most GRC professionals write policies and manage spreadsheets. I architect and build the technical systems that satisfy those controls:

- **Cloud governance** — Deploy production-ready AWS baselines in hours
- **Endpoint compliance** — Deliver hardened configs with complete evidence packs
- **Compliance automation** — Build intake workflows, not just document them
- **Detection engineering** — Author SIEM rules, tune false positives, write playbooks
- **AI-augmented delivery** — 10× velocity with human review

> *"Pharns delivered a complete compliance package with documentation quality that rivals consultants with twice his experience. His ability to implement technical controls while maintaining audit-ready evidence is rare."*
>
> — Security stakeholder, client engagement via AAM Cyber, LLC

# Welcome to Pharns' Cybersecurity Portfolio! 👋

> **Cybersecurity Specialist | Threat Hunter | Innovating at the Intersection of Technology and Security**

Hi there! I'm **Pharns** (pronounced "Founce"), a certified cybersecurity professional passionate about safeguarding systems and solving real-world security challenges. With certifications like **CompTIA Security+**, **Network+**, and **(ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity**, I specialize in **threat detection**, **incident response**, and **vulnerability management**.

In my hands-on experience:
- I’ve built a robust homelab featuring tools like **The Hive**, **Nessus**, and **Security Onion** to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios.
- As a licensed drone pilot and builder, I’m developing a **proof of concept** to demonstrate how drones equipped with SDR (software-defined radio) can exploit vulnerabilities—merging cutting-edge technology with cybersecurity research.
- My penetration testing toolkit includes tools like the **WiFi Pineapple**, **HackRF One**, and **Rubber Ducky**, which I use to explore wireless auditing and exploit testing.

I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills, certifications, and passion for cybersecurity to solve emerging threats. Explore my portfolio below to see how I combine creativity, technical expertise, and hands-on experience to make an impact.

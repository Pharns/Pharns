# Welcome to Pharns' Cybersecurity Portfolio! 👋

> **Cybersecurity Specialist | Threat Hunter | Innovating at the Intersection of Technology and Security**

Hi there! I'm **Pharns** (pronounced "Founce"), a certified cybersecurity professional passionate about safeguarding systems and solving real-world security challenges. With [certifications](#-certifications) like **CompTIA Security+**, **CompTIA Network+**, and **(ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity**, I specialize in **threat detection**, **incident response**, and **vulnerability management**.

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (BSCIA) at Western Governors University (WGU), with plans to continue into the Master's program. This academic pursuit complements my hands-on experience and industry certifications, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining cutting-edge knowledge in the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape.

Experience:
- Devloped a homelab featuring tools such as **The Hive**, **Nessus**, and **Security Onion** to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios.
- Licensed drone pilot and builder. My **proof of concept** merges cutting-edge technology and cybersecurity research. It demonstrates how drones equipped with Software-Defined Radio (SDR) can exploit vulnerabilities.
- My penetration testing toolkit includes the **WiFi Pineapple**, **HackRF One**, **Flipper Zero**, and **Rubber Ducky**, which I use to explore wireless auditing, RFID/NFC analysis, and exploit testing.
  
**Career Goal** -- seeking a position/role/opportunity that utilizes my skills, technical expertise, experience, and professional [certifications](#-certifications) while fulfilling my passion for solving ongoing cybersecurity threats.

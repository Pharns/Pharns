# Welcome to Pharns' Cybersecurity Portfolio! 👋

Hi there! I'm **Pharns** (pronounced "Founce"), a certified cybersecurity professional with expertise in **threat detection**, **incident response**, and **vulnerability management**. With certifications like **CompTIA Security+**, **Network+**, and **(ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity**, I apply my skills through a robust **homelab** featuring tools like **The Hive**, **Nessus**, and **Security Onion**.

As a **licensed professional drone pilot and builder**, I’m developing a **proof of concept** showcasing how drones equipped with SDR (software-defined radio) can exploit vulnerabilities in computers—merging cutting-edge technology with cybersecurity research. I’m also advancing my skills in **penetration testing** using tools like the **WiFi Pineapple**, **HackRF One**, and **Rubber Ducky** for wireless auditing and exploit testing.

I’m seeking a role where I can apply my skills, certifications, and passion for cybersecurity to solve emerging threats. Explore my portfolio below to see how I combine creativity and technical expertise to make a meaningful impact.
